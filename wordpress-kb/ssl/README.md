# SSL - certificates for development

Since [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org) requires a secure connection as an OIDC Relying Party, development certificates are included in this repository.

- `privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
- `fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software (copy of chain.pem for development purposes).
- `chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7

These certificates are self signed, and as such not reckognized by any CA. Do not use this for anything beyond local development (Never use in production)

### Generate `privkey.pem`, `fullchain.pem`, `chain.pem`

Certificate generation based on Let's Encrypt [certificates for localhost](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/).

```
openssl req -x509 -outform pem -out chain.pem -keyout privkey.pem \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -days 3650 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
cat chain.pem > fullchain.pem
```
