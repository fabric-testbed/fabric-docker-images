The Dockerfiles found here are used to build docker images used by the fabric-prometheus system found in the MeasurementFramework repo.  
The fabric-prometheus system is containerized and run on each rack's head node. Most of the containers just use the standard builds found on DockerHub.  Images that are not available on DockerHub can be built from Dockerfiles found here.
